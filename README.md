# What is YouSport
Our System will focus on the “Digital Twins” representation of various courts, public parks and or locations that allow people to exercise, play team sports and improve their physical health in the process. We aim to target places such as basketball courts, outdoor gyms, tennis courts and more.

# The System will allow users:
● Filter locations based on the users activity preferences.

● Update a locations status based on real life state (Closed/Occupied/In repair/etc)

● Be informed about the location's opening hours (If there are any).

● Know if the location requires booking in advance, if so - display the required price.

● Let other users know if a location is temporarily unavailable.

# Purpose of the System
The main purpose of our application is to allow people who are interested in sporting
activities to exercise in appropriate locations by eliminating the irrelevant places for
them. Allowing users to find the relevant court for their need ahead of time should ease
the process of going to exercise and take care of their physical health.
A typical user will be able to select a sporting activity i.e Basketball and only see
locations that allow him to play Basketball, as such - football fields / tennis courts and
other locations will not be shown.

# Scope of the System
For the scope of this project we have chosen to focus on the basic requirements of such a
software to provide a minimum viable product for a user to experience.
Due to the limited time and ability, we chose to focus on the following:
● Searching for locations based on sport preference and distance

● The ability to view the locations opening hours (if relevant)

● View a photo of the location ahead of arrival

● Know the current status of a locations i.e Occupied/Closed/Being Repaired and more

● The ability to add a sport to a location if needed

● Know ahead of time if a location requires some kind of payment to use
# Functional Requirements

10. The ability to add a sporting activity to the location if the location is not updated
to support it in the application
11. The ability to view a location’s photo ahead of arrival to know the condition of the
location
